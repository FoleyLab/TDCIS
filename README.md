# TDCIS FDTD/TDCIS for electronic dynamics in metal nanoparticles driven by scattering mediated absorption

This code was used to produce the results described in a [recent paper 
in ACS Photonics](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acsphotonics.6b00773); the 
formalism is described in detail in that paper as well.

The main source code is found in TDCIS.c.
